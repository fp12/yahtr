Humble attempt at building a Tactical RPG I would play.

Core concepts:
* Hex grid, because I want to toy with it
* Twist on attack system: not based on hex tiles but edges instead
* Units evolution is for diversity: each unit class has its own purpose so you may not want to evolve them without thinking about it

Contributions:
* Code: not needed for features, but any code advice is welcome!
* Art/Sounds/Music: I'm not set on a universe/setting yet, so feel free to propose!
* Localization: feel free to contribute here: [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/LUAmx4i9PS)
