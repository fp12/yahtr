_Yet Another Hex Tactical RPG_
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fp12/yahtr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fp12/yahtr)


Humble attempt at building a Tactical RPG I would play.

Core concepts:
* Hex grid, because I want to toy with it
* Twist on attack system: not based on hex tiles but edges instead
* Units evolution is for diversity: each unit class has its own purpose so you may not want to evolve them mindlessly

Let me know if you want to contribute to code or art! I'm open!
